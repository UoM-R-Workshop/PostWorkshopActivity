# Post Workshop Activity

A new cleaned dataset has been uploaded for you to work with directly: data_cleaned_postworkshop_activity.csv

The code file used to generate this from data_input has also been uploaded: CleaningDataForPostWorkshopActivity.R

The pdf file contains a description of the activity. If you wish to receive feedback then please send your script to harriet.cant@manchester.ac.uk by **the end of April**. We highly encourage people to send your script to us - you tend to be better at coding/commenting if you know someone else is going to see it, and so it's really good practice. This is absolutely not a test of any sort and the intention is to give you pointers for where you could improve. If you get error messages, we will give you feedback that describes why you are getting them. If you don't get error messages, then we can give you feedback which might point to where your code could be better formatted, or made more efficient. If you would like to know how to do something, we can also provide you with feedback that goes through this (e.g. "how would I change X?", "how would I analyse Y?"). There is no obligation to send us your script.
